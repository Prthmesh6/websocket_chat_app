# WebSocket Chat Application

Welcome to my WebSocket-based chat application! This project demonstrates a simple chat application using WebSocket technology.

## Features

1. **Authentication:** Users can authenticate by providing their username and password. Only valid credentials allow the establishment of a WebSocket connection.
   
2. **Ping Pong Mechanism:** The application regularly sends ping messages to the server, expecting a pong response. If the server fails to respond within a defined timeframe or after a certain number of retries, the WebSocket connection is automatically terminated.
   
3. **Real-time Chat:** Once connected, users can join chat rooms and exchange messages. Messages sent by one user are instantly visible to all participants in the same chat room.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** [Specify the backend technologies used, e.g., Go, Node.js, etc.]
- **Frontend:** [Mention the frontend technologies, e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.]
- **WebSocket Protocol:** Utilizes the WebSocket protocol for real-time communication.
