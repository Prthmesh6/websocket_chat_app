## websocket_chat_app

This repo is a representation of how the Websockets work, I have added the authentication as well as the Origin check when establishing the websocket connection initially. We can add a tls certificate to make it wss connection.
Also this does ping-pong to check whether connected or not, if we are not getting pong upto a certain limit then the connection will get broken.
I have made this just for a learning purpose. If you wanna clone and run this repo, please use username = prathmesh and password = 123
